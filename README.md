<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>This Python project enables face detection and door unlocking. The application detects the face, activates an LED, and rotates a servo motor when the name is spoken.</p>
<h3>Needs:</h3>
<p> -OpenCV</p>
<p> -Python</p>
<p> -Putty</p>
<p> -WinSCP</p>
<p> -VNC viewer</p>
<p> -Numpy</p>
<p> -Raspberry Pi</p>
<h3>Code Building</h3>
<p>To create a complete Face Recognition project, we need to work on 3 distinct phases: 

Face recognition.
<h4>1-data collection.</h4>
The code provided captures the video stream generated by your PC's camera, displaying it in both BGR color and grayscale modes.
    cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
Next, we need to "mark" the faces in the image, for example, with a red rectangle. This is done with the following part of the code:
    cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 0, 255), 2)
We will simply create a dataset where we will store, for each identifier, a group of photos
<h4>2-Image transformation.</h4>
During this second phase, we need to take all the user data and transcribe it into a matrix. The result will be a .yml file named "trainingdata" which will be saved in a directory called "recognizer".

<h4>3-Face recognition.</h4>
<p>We will capture a new face on our camera, and if this person's face has already been captured and trained, our recognizer will make a "prediction" returning their identifier and an index, indicating how confident the recognizer is with this match.
Finally, if the recognizer cannot do so, a label "unknown" is affixed to the face.</p>
